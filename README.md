## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Some of my favorite applications:
- Oak: A meditation app that has a relatively simple UI compared to other meditation apps I've tried. It is easy to navigate, doesn't provide an overwhelming amount of choices, and has an earthy color scheme. 
- Google Drive: I like the search feature and the ability to navigate between different accounts as I have a personal, work, and school account I need to switch between. I also like that recently opened files are available to edit offline.
- MyFitnessPal: I really like the visualizations they provide to see how much progress you are making. Entering the data is relatively simple and the app does all the calculations for you.

An app idea:

Travel Buddy is a hypothetical platform that lets solo travelers to find companions for their trips based on shared interests and travel preferences. Some features it would have:
- User profiles with personal information, travel preferences, interests, and a bio.
- Search filters to help users find travel companions based on criteria such as destination, travel dates, gender preferences, age range, interests, and more.
- A chat system that enables users to communicate with potential travel buddies within the app.
- A matching algorithm that suggests potential travel buddies to users based on their profiles, interests, and preferences.
- Identity verification for user safety
- Options to create or join group trips
- Push notifications for messages
